# This is the code for my Telerilevamento Geo-Ecologico exam
# This code will focus to the loss of snow of the Taku glacier, in Alaska

# The code will show the following ponits:
# 1. pca calculation (principal component analysis)
# 2. loss of snow cover calculation
# 3. standard deviation calculation to show the most changed points

# First thing we need to set the working directory
setwd("C:/Lab/Esame")

# After that we need to download and call the packages that we will use later
# install.packages ("raster")
library (raster)
